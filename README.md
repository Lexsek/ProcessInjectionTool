# ProcessInjectionTool

Process injection tool, in order to explain how different process injection methods works and cool tricks with WINAPI.

## Applications, Processus and Threads

There are 3 differents important names that you must understand in Windows before starting explaining injection.

Applications is the main name that you give to an executable, for example firefox.exe.

Processus is the name you give of each instances of the application.

Thread is the name you give to sequences of instructions that can be managed independently.

An application can have 1 or more process running abd each process have at least 1 thread or more.

## Some Windows Structures

There are some windows structures that you must understand aswell.

TEB : Thread Environment Block

The Thread Environment Block (TEB) structure describes the state of a thread. It is accessible from the FS segment register.

PEB : Process Environment Block

The Process Environment Block (PEB) is a user-mode data structure that can be used by applications (and by extend by malware) to get information such as the list of loaded modules, process startup arguments, heap address, check whether program is being debugged, find image base address of imported DLLs, ...

PEB_LDR_DATA :

The PEB_LDR_DATA structure is a structure that contains information about all of the loaded modules in the current process.

LIST_ENTRY :
    
A LIST_ENTRY structure describes an entry in a doubly linked list or serves as the header for such a list.

Flink : For a LIST_ENTRY structure that serves as a list entry, the Flink member points to the next entry in the list or to the list header if there is no next entry in the list. For a LIST_ENTRY structure that serves as the list header, the Flink member points to the first entry in the list or to the LIST_ENTRY structure itself if the list is empty.

Blink : For a LIST_ENTRY structure that serves as a list entry, the Blink member points to the previous entry in the list or to the list header if there is no previous entry in the list. For a LIST_ENTRY structure that serves as the list header, the Blink member points to the last entry in the list or to the LIST_ENTRY structure itself if the list is empty.

LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY :
    
LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY structure contains informations about a module.

PROCESS_ENTRY :
   
Describes an entry from a list of the processes residing in the system address space when a snapshot was taken.

## What is process injection ?

Process injection is a name given to the action of injecting remote code in another process.

For example, you take 2 processus, the injector named injector.exe and a classic text editor named notepad.exe.

The objective of injector.exe is to write in the process memory of the notepad.exe processus in order to execute it remotely and hide the execution of potential malicious code.

Malicious actions will now be executed by notepad.exe, that is quite interesting. Here we used notepad.exe as an example, but imagine a malicious code injecting himself into explorer.exe and reading sensitive file system files, logging them, or injecting into firefox to send the keylogging to the C&C server of the attaquant as firefox is making a lot of network connections.

## Different injection types

Here I've develloped a C program doing each cases of injection.

We will see 4 different techniques, in my C program, and also in the x86 version of it like a reverse-engineer would see my program if he had to reverse it.

### Process Crawling

The first step on injection is to find the process you want to open and it's PID.

In my exercise tool, I'm doing a crawl of the process in order to find if the specified PID in the console is valid or not.
(If a process with this PID is currently running on my computer).

C Code :

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lexsek/ProcessInjectionTool/master/images/c_crawlprocess.png
"C crawl process")

So I call CrawlProcess giving a PID

Then I'm assigning a PROCESSENTRY32 structure to pe32

Then I'm calling CreateToolhelp32Snapshot, that takes a snapshot of the specified processes, as well as the heaps, modules, and threads used by these processes.

Then I'm checking if the call was successful or not

If that was succesful I'm assigning the right size for my PROCESSENTRY32 structure

Then I'm calling Process32First that retrieves information about the first process encountered in a system snapshot.

If the call is sucessful, I'm finally calling Process32Next that retrieves information about the next process recorded in a system snapshot, until the last process.

If the current snapshot of the process is matching the given pid during the loop, I return 0.

### Classic Injection :

Classic injection is quite easy, after you found the good PID you have to:

Open the process with OpenProcess,

Allocate memory inside it using VirtualAllocEx,

Write memory inside it using WriteProcessMemory,

Execute the shellcode you've injected calling CreateRemoteThread.


### RunPE (Process Hollowing) :

### Process Doppelg√§nging :

### Ctrl-Inject :
